# Raduno! Catch up without the fuss

Raduno! is the application that helps you arrange all your group activities swiftly, fairly and democratically.

## What does the app do?

Our app removes the friction and hassle from arranging those large group social events with your friends or family.
It does this by making it easy to set up polls to vote on potentially divisive subjects such as where to go, what to do, and what date to pick. The voting is done in a fair and transparent manner that keeps everyone happy.
There is also a social element to the app, with a comments section for each event, where people can share thoughts and feelings, and work out the minutia of where to park, what to wear etc.
It is solving the problems around organising activities for a group of people, and the friction that is usually involved in getting group decisions quickly and democratically.

the application that helps you swiftly organise your group activities, by rounding up your friends or family by event, and enabling them to have their say on what to do or where to go fairly and democratically
